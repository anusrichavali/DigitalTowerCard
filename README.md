# DigitalTowerCard

This proof-of-concept iOS application allows SJSU students to enter their credentials in order to retrieve a digital version of the Tower Card. The app has a tap functionality that uses NFC scanning. When combined with student data, this digital card should be scannable at buildings around campus.
